# Crowdfunding_ETL

Project 2

For the ETL mini project, we are working with a partner to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. We are creating four CSV files and use the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema after we have transformed the data. In the end, we are uploading data from CSV files to a Postgres database.

The instructions for this mini project are divided into the following subsections:
Create the Category and Subcategory DataFrames
Create the Campaign DataFrame
Create the Contacts DataFrame
Create the Crowdfunding Database
