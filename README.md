# Crowdfunding_ETL

Project 2

In order to extract, transform, and load crowdfunding data from Excel files into a relational database, a collaborative project is developing an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and PostgreSQL.

In this project, we practiced building an ETL pipeline to process crowdfunding data from Excel files. We are extracting and converting data, creating four CSV files for the Entity Diagram Relationship ERD schema, after which we use them to create a Table Schema. And finally, we've imported the CSV files to a PostgreSQL database.
